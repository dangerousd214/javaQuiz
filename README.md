# javaQuiz

## Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to practice the skills you've learned, I invite you to take a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
